Partial Prey

--> At the start

    P(0,N) = 1/49, for all N not containig the Agent
           = 0, if N contained the Agent

--> When Agent surveys at time t

    Surveyed a node X

    Case 1: Prey is not found at node X

        P(prey is at node N | surevey did not find prey at X) = P(Prey is at N)/P(Prey is not at X), for all N != X

--> When Prey Moves at time (t+1)

    P(Prey is at N Now) = 
    Summation(i = 1 to 50) P(Prey is at N Now and prey was at i then) 
    = P(Prey was at N then and Prey is at N Now) + summation(i=1 to 50 and i != N) P(Prey was at I then) * P(Prey is at N now | Prey was at i then)



Partial Predator

--> At the start

--> When Agent surveys at time t

    Surveyed a node X

--> When Predator moves at time (t+1)

    P(Predator is at Node N now)

Complete Partial defective drone

The only change happens when Agent surveys or moves and the dron gives false negative

--> When Agent surveys node X at time t

    Case 1: Prey not found

            P(Prey is at node N | surevey did not find Prey at X)    = (P(Prey is at N)*(0.1))/(1-0.9*P(Prey is at X)), for all N != X
